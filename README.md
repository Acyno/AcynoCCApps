==================

If you download the zip-master for the Apps,

to Install the .file to computers, first you have

to identify the ID with os.getComputerID()

Then go into .minecraft/saves/<WORLD NAME>/computer/

Open the Folder that corresponds with what os.getComputerID() returns

Copy and paste my API and the Apps you want into the computer

Open Minecraft, open your Computercraft Computer, and run the Apps

(Besure to load the API first!)
